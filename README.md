# Upper Arlington High School Coding Track

Good morning and welcome to the 2024 Nationwide Sponsored Hackathon!

We are excited to put on this year's coding challenge through CodeWars. If you do not have an account already, please [create one here](https://www.codewars.com/join). 

If you are interested in taking part in an optional competition, fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdM9IFBJz2gO7DvpHDomgdEEWoSJzf1QW5rOQlr5QitsE505Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). We will track which problems you have solved and announce the leaders throughout the event. At the end of the day, the winners will be expected to present some of their solutions to the harder questions to the group. 

If you do not wish to participate in the competition, feel free to work through the problems at your own pace and in whatever groups you like. 

We have selected [48 katas](./assets/files/ChallengeList.md) for this hackathon. Only problems from the list attached that are completed within the time frame of this hackathon will count towards scoring for the competition. You are allowed to use Google for syntax and basic coding questions but nothing more. 

Feel free to pull one of our volunteers aside at any time for questions or a chat. We are more than happy to get to know you.
